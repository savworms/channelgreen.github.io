 <h1>ABOUT!</h1>
 <h3>Get your quick facts about me here:</h3>
 <ul><li>Teetotaling all-american transgender.</li>
    <li>Seventeen years old (non-fox years).</li>
    <li>I'm *pretty* sure my eyes are hazel, but everyone thinks they're green.</li>
    <li>Lover of all things worms, snoopy, or presidential.</li>
    <li>$0.90/hour video editor.</li>
    <p>On February 6th, 2008, my mother had the bright idea to concieve her third child (SPOILER: IT'S ME). This child would go on to gain a casual
        (though sometimes competitive) interest in reading, writing, audiovisual editing, & journalism.
